# 4th_Sem_Innovative_Project:-


📌 Project Overview:-

This project extracts key legal sections from three major acts:
Negotiable Instruments Act (NIA), 1881
Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961
Copyright Act, 1957
The extracted six sections are then structured and converted into JSON format for easy analysis and retrieval.


🚀 Features:-

LEVEL1:-
✅ Extracts key sections from three different legal acts.
✅ Cleans and formats legal text for better readability.
✅ Converts structured data into JSON format for efficient storage.

LEVEL2:-
✅ Removes stopwords and unnecessary text for concise content.


🛠️ Tech Stack:-

Python 🐍 (For text extraction & processing)
JSON 📂 (For structured data storage)
NLTK / Scikit-Learn 🧠 (For text preprocessing)


🔧 How It Works:-

Extract Legal Text: Parse six sections from the three acts.
Convert to JSON: Store structured sections in key-value format.
Preprocess Content: Remove stopwords & special characters.
Save Output: Generate a clean JSON file for further use.
